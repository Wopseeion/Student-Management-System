I'll be describing how to run the web-application

First , downlaod the file and unzip it 
Secondly , OPEN CMD  terminal from the zipped file location 
Once you have entered the cmd terminal with the set file location of "manage.py" file 
Execute this command --> "python manage.py runserver"
After this the web-app will be hosted on your local server -> which is mostly : "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
Once you have enter the login page , Check out the read me file from the folder as input the username and password given from their . 
Thank you
